# recipe-calc

## What it is

It's a basic calculating tool for crafting chains, mostly for Factorio.
And it's not nearly finished, I'm working on it :3

## How to use

1. ``make run exe=<your executable name here>``
2. ``./<your executable> help`` to list all available commands (more to come than just 4)
3. enjoy

Happy crafting!
